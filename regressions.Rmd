This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#mydata <- read.table("SBA_Loan_data.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", fill=TRUE)
mydata <- read.csv("SBA_Loan_data.csv")
# Making new column boolean for default status
mydata$defaulted <- mydata$GrossChargeOffAmount > 0

#Calculating overall percentage of loans defaulted (in progress)
sum(!mydata$defaulted)

# Multiple Linear Regression Example
fit <- lm.fit(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data=mydata)
summary(fit) # show results
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
